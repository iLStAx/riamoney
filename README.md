## Project Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run Project

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Routes
- list/table -> all products
- products/:id -> show one product

## Product

- Use tailwind for apply fast styles to components
- Use tanstack-query to handle life cycle for fetching when request internal API and apply cache to responses
- Show total stock, average and most common category on list table (most important infomation by my POV)

## Current Limitations

- Filter by name or price
- Sorting by name or price
- Pagination

## Improvements

- UX/UI interface (add more friendly colors or usage maybe)
- Testing internal API and React components
